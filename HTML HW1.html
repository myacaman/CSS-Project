			<p> Getting products with a close to flawless user experience out the door is increasingly important. Companies have responded to this key factor by hiring consultants or professionals in UX design; nevertheless, organizations still fail to consistently get the results they desire.
				<strong>This website will help you improve your UX!</strong>

			<h2>Assess Your Company</h2>
			<p>Determine the stage your company is at and start working on improving UX Design!</p>

				<tr>
					<!--6 table headers-->
					<th> Criteria</th>
					<th> Stage 1: Unenlightened</th>
					<th> Stage 2: Awakening </th>
					<th> Stage 3: Enlightened </th>
					<th> Stage 4: Super Human </th>
					<th> Stage 5: Celestial </th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<!--Row 1-->
					<td id="column"><strong> Description</strong></td>
					<td>Design is perceived as something to be "layered" on top of the product's functionality. User experience at this stage is just seen as visual design.</td>
					<td>At this stage, the organization may be genuinely considering UX design with an eye towards improving it, but still with little formal structure.</td>
					<td>It is now doing UX design "right", or at least significantly better, on some projects. There is growing belief among the leadership team of the value of design and investments are being made in professional hires or contractors.</td>
					<td>They are now more concerned with the nuances or particulars of improvement in UX. UX goals are clearly embedded with the organization's mindset and people understand their roles in the process.</td>
					<td>When your organization is "celestial" in its strategic implementation of UX design principles, UX design is firmly integrated into all aspects of customer experience.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<!--Row 2-->
					<td id="column"><strong> Factors to Achieve Next Level</strong></td>
					<td>A sense of awareness needs to be created in the organization. It can be done through some education or through a life-changing experience where the company loses against a competitor who was better UX design.</td>
					<td>To build on the beginnings of awareness, launch a pilot project, overseen by experts, with a clear connection between UX design goals and a business objective.</td>
					<td>Setting clear UX goals for teams on projects is the next step. Roles need to be defined so that everyone on a project contributes to UX outcomes. UX experts must both be empowered and take accountability for their roles. </td>
					<td>Organizations must start planning complete customer experiences that go beyond the UX of the product alone. This means understanding from a customer point of view what the experience is with the company as a whole and how the product fits in with that experience.</td>
					<td>There is not another level; however, this that does not imply that there is no room for improvement and maintenance. Improving UX constantly through creativity is key.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<!--Row 3-->
					<td id="column"><strong> Bottom Line</strong></td>
					<td>The bottom line on why good UX is not getting out the door: sadly, no one, or almost no one, understands or cares about it!</td>
					<td>The bottom line on why very little good UX is getting out the door: despite glimmers of awareness, thereâ€™s just insufficient expert UX horsepower and no entrenched practices.</td>
					<td>The bottom line on why good UX is now sometimes getting out the door: the relevant UX expertise is now largely in place at the working level. You must have UX experts willing to take initiative, collaborate and integrate with other functions and the leadership to make it happen.</td>
					<td>The bottom line on why excellent UX is now regularly getting out the door: There is expert UX representation at every level and department involved in the product design process. Practices, process, and roles are well understood. UX design is clearly linked to business and product goals. And it's tracked.</td>
					<td>The bottom line on why outstanding customer experience is regularly getting out the door: the customer's experience is designed from his/her point of view with the necessary customer feedback/research and expertise from all company functions involved.</td>

			<h2>Aspects of UX Design</h2>
			<p>As you strive to deliver better UX, take into consideration the following three aspecs of design.</p>

			<div id="main" class="block">
				<ul>
					<li id="list"><strong> Aesthetics:</strong> focuses on the product looking good. The product needs to be "fun" to interact with and it has a "clean" layout. In other words, the product has to be attractive to the eye.</li>

					<li id="list"><strong>Functionality:</strong> focuses mainly on the value that it gives the user. For example, it is valuable that a user can run an antivirus on their computer. They might not know how to run and they have to figure it out, but it has value.</li>

					<li id="list"><strong> Usability:</strong> focuses on guaranteeing that the product is effective, efficient, satisfying, and simple. Usability is how functionality is delivered to users.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<!--Section 3-->
		<section id="footer">
			<h2>Delivering Value</h2>
			<p>A user cannot get a positive emotional value, without some utilitarian value.</p>

			<!--Unordered list-->
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Emotional Value:</strong> this value can be perceived when a user says, "I love my iPod!"</li>
				<li><strong>Utalitarian Value:</strong> this value can be percieved when a user says, "A mobile phone? Wow! Now I can call my friends from anywhere!"</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Organizations that can deliver both, emotional and utalitarian value, have managen to provide their customers with the best UX. Organizations that follow these standards also share the following characteristics:</p>

			<!--Ordered list-->
			<ol>
				<li>They have expertise in house and/or call on experts in UX when they need it.</li>
				<li>They use appropriate techniques to obtain and understand user input.</li>
				<li>The leadership and culture in the company appreciates the value and necessity of UX design from a business point of view.</li>
				<li>There are connected and integrated processes that enable individuals to work together to create the user experience of the products.</li>
				<li>The principles of UX design are applied in the broadest perspective possible to drive consistent customer experience.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2> How to Start Working on Your UX? </h2>

				<p> Like any model, this 5-stage framework may not exactly match the specifics of a particular organization. In the real world, companies display a mix of characteristics from different stages across their organization. Nevertheless, assessing your company against these broad categories still provides useful insights into how to evolve your business to create better user experiences in the products that reach your customers.</p>

				<p>Organizations and people learn by doing! So identify a project or product where the value of UX design can be showcased (if you are early stage) or enhanced and integrated (if you are more sophisticated). Consulting the indicators of UX maturity in our table, zero-in on the key aspects of the project to target for greater UX design impact.</p>

				<p>Sustaining progress over the longer term is challenging. But the starting point is almost always a single successful project. For the best chance of success, kick things off with UX design education or training for key team members, and cap the project with a formal debrief that evaluates the success of the design process and its impact on the product.</p>

				<p>It's also a good idea to involve a business savvy expert in UX design to help you lever this project to spark change in the company. The person may already exist within your organization or you may need to tap into some outside help.</p>
